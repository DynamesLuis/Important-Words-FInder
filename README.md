# 📌 Important Words Finder Using TF-IDF
This project identifies the most important words in a text using the **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) statistical measure.  
TF-IDF scores words based on how frequently they appear in a document relative to other documents, helping to highlight the most relevant terms in a collection of texts.
